CRASH_v2dot3:

CRASH changes:
	Generalized MHD to RZ geometry. Added IsRzGeometry variable.
	Added #BIERMANNBATTERY command to switch on Biermann battery term
		without Hall MHD.
	Added resistivity calculation for non-ideal EOS. 
	Do not use div B control in 1D.

	Moved laser package from the SWMF into BATSRUS. Fixed several bugs.
	Added #LASERPULSE, #LASERBEAMS, #LASERBEAM commands into PARAM.XML
		(similar commands were in the user module).
	Added 'elaser' plot function into BATSRUS (was in user module).

	Added #MINIMUMPRESSURE command to put a lower floor on pressure.

	Improved accuracy of face gradient calculation (3rd order ghost cells)
		and generalized to 1D and 2D. Used by flux limiters, 
		and resistivity.

	EOS table sizes were modified to accomodate pure hydro runs
	with extremely cold plastic. This has small effects on all CRASH
	runs using tables.

	Added #RHOINSIDE command into user section of ModUserCrash to set
		density inside tube.
	Added #MAXRESISTIVITY command into user section of ModUserCrash to set
		maximum resistivity (to allow larger explicit time steps).

	Generalized BATL to work for Tecplot output files (in 3D).
	Check ghost cell settings in BATL_size.
	BATL can now message pass scalars (will be useful for laser package).
	BATL can now find neighboring cells in the tree (will be useful for
		laser package).

	Added test_opac target into util/CRASH/Makefile and a new executable.
	Added CONVERT_ARTEP tartget.

	Use separate default temperature ranges for EOS and opacity tables.
	Switched off optimization of ModFermiGas for all compilers.
	Avoid compiler bug in ModEos.f90.


CRASHTEST:
	Added Mhd/Biermann
	Added Mhd/Resistivity
	Added test_tube_2d_mhd into FullSystem/Version2/
	updated reference solutions in FullSystem/Version1
	updated reference solutions in FullSystem/Version2
	updated reference solutions in IdealGas/Graydiffusion
	updated reference solution for lighfront test in Radiation/Graydiffusion
	updated reference solution for lighfront test in Radiation/Multigroup

	plot 'zavg' in FullSystem/Version2/test_tube_multigroupcond


IDL plotting:
	Added log-linear and log-log plotmodes in IDL marcros.
	Allow overplot and noaxis options for 1D plots.
	Bug fix in rel_error for 2D problems.

SWMF changes:
	Added DEMTDIR (Differential Emmission Measure library for solar corona)
	Changed magnetometer output.
	Added #CPCPBOUNDARY, #GEOMAGINDICES commands.
	Added #RESISTIVITYREGION command to limit resistivity to a region.
	Added #LDEM commands (was in user module).
	Modified #IMCOUPLING command.
	Fixed arbitrarily truncated command names:
		#ACTIVEREGIONHEATING, #LONGSCALEHEATING, #RADIATIVECOOLING.
	Removed obsolete #HEATFLUX command.
	Order of variables fixed in anisotropic pressure equation modules.
	Fixed current calculations at resolution changes and near bodies. 
		Effects many tests calculating Dst, inflowing or outflowing 
		currents, etc.
	Fixed magnetometer test so the grid fits into 1 processor.
	Updated Mars multifluid code and test.
	Fixed CON_geopack bug and extended year range to 2015.
	Improved ModReadParam for use with FDIPS code.
	Improved CheckDataName.pl
	Allow SWMF_data to be in local SWMF directory.
	Concatenate IE magnetometer output.
	Accomodate absoft compiler??
	ModBatlInterface now sets iBlock_A and iProc_A
	Added Climit option for the "old" Roe solver
	Bug fix for restart files with face B and/or implicit old
	Some changes for satellite mapping for CRCM and RBE
	Fixed solar wind electron pressure defaults
	Added new features into IH user file (boundary conditions for tests).
	Added new things into ScHeat and ScWaves user modules.
	Added new things into Waves user module.
	Added parallel potential field solver FDIPS and corresponding test.
	Improved serial potential field solver source code.
	Fixed bug in NOMPI/src/Makefile dependencis.

	BATL can now handle unused cells for AMR.
	BATL has now interpolate_grid function to interpolate on AMR grid.
	BATL can message pass using "min" or "max" in the restriction step.
