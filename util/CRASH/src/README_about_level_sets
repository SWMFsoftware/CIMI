Dear Igor,
I have attached 2 fortran files, containing two different 1D compressible
multifluid algorithms.

hybrid_level_set.f - uses the pressure evolution equation instead of energy 
equation across material interfaces.Ê
2-flux.f - uses 2 different fluxes across matrial interface to update fluids 
on left/right.

Both programs are self contained except they require 3 input parameters, 
which they read from fort.90 (also attached) and print output to fort.14 to 
fort.18 . The actual solver is in routine ROE or ROE1D. 
Best,
Smadar
