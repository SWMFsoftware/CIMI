The demo version IDL script can run on both Mac and PC computers with IDL and the general package of SolarSoftware (Plot_image command is used). To run the code, simply input: "SWMF_GLSETUP". Then:

1. Input the observed CME speed.
2. Input the SWMF input magnetic field data (FDIPS). Can be in ASCII and Binary format
2. Click (LEFT Button) the CME source region with the positive polarity.
3. Click (RIGHT Button) the CME source region with the negative polarity.

To run the code in DemoMode:

SWMF_GLSETUP,/DEMOMODE

To specify the layers of magnetogram:

SWMF_GLSETUP,PLOTRADIUS=1.03

To calcuate the flux rope orientation based on the PIL:

SWMF_GLSETUP,/USEPIL

The recommended GL flux rope parameters will be calculated and shown.

*For Mac users, the IDL "CURSOR" routine may hang and does not return output. There is an easy fix for that problem. If you are using Mac OS X 10.7 or higher, 2 steps to get the CURSOR routine work:

1. Open the X11 preferences dialog, then select the "Windows" pane.
2. Enable "Click-through Inactive Windows."
