In this chapter we will provide some examples of how to actually use the 
CIMI model. After reading this chapter you should be familiar enough with the 
use of the model to setup your own simple runs. Three stand-alone examples are 
provided: 
 

\section{Example 1}

\subsection{Configuration and Compilation for theExample 1}
The default configuration of the CIMI is... To check the 
current configuration, type
\begin{verbatim}
  Config.pl
\end{verbatim}
from the CIMI directory. If the CIMI is not currently configured for the expanded grid, then type
\begin{verbatim}
  Config.pl -GridExpanded
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Example 2: ...}

Entering IDL you can then visualize 
the solution using the 
\begin{verbatim}
  .r getpict
  .r plotfunc
\end{verbatim}
commands as described in the BATS-R-US manual.
